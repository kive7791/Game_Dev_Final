Develop a 2D point-and-click adventure where the player uncovers a story by locating specific items. The game features a choice-and-consequence system; finding all items in the correct order leads to a favorable outcome while missing or misordering them results in an unhappy ending. The atmosphere progressively becomes creepier, drawing players deeper into the mystery. I want to have some puzzles around the area that unlock other areas.

The storyboards will likely change as I develop the storyline. They are to show what I would like the functions to be and making items glow red if the user needs help.
